## 📦 Requirements

Install the dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pyttsx3 SpeechRecognition pyaudio requests wikipedia pywhatkit pyjokes openai
```

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Listens** to your voice command using `SpeechRecognition`
2. **Processes** it using custom logic (or OpenAI for advanced Q&A)
3. **Responds** via `pyttsx3` text-to-speech
4. Executes commands like:
   - Opening websites
   - Telling the time
   - Searching Wikipedia
   - Telling jokes
   - And more...

---

## 🚀 Usage

1. Run the Python file:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. Speak a command:
   - “Open Google”
   - “Tell me a joke”
   - “What time is it?”
